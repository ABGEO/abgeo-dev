Hello there, I am Temuri Takalandze - a passionate Software Engineer with extensive experience in back-end development, specializing in PHP, Python, and currently thriving in Go. My expertise spans the creation of high-performance, scalable, and cloud-native applications for both WEB and CLI-based solutions, leveraging Go’s exceptional capabilities.

As an Open Source advocate, I have contributed to renowned projects such as Symfony, phpMyAdmin, Slim Framework, Composer, and many more. My own projects include award-winning PHP libraries, like “gen-md,” a recipient of the PHP Innovation Award, as well as Informatics.Ge, a thriving online programming competition platform with thousands of active users.

In addition to software development, I have strong DevOps experience, focusing on automation, containerization, CI/CD, monitoring, and automated testing. I enjoy crafting robust infrastructure with AWS and Kubernetes, using tools like Terraform and Ansible to bring Infrastructure-as-Code and Configuration-as-Code to life.

Beyond software engineering, I pursue hobbies in reverse engineering, hardware hacking, and IoT and embedded engineering. These interests fuel my passion for understanding and innovating at the intersection of software and hardware.

Driven by innovation and collaboration, I am committed to delivering impactful solutions and contributing to the tech community through Open Source and beyond.
